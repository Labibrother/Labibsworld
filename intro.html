				<h2>Life so far...</h2>
				<p>
					I am Labib, from Bangladesh, currently studying Digital Business &amp; Innovation in Tokyo International University.
				</p>
				<p>
					I like to meet new people, exchange cultures, but I also enjoy solitude sometimes. As a Bangladeshi, I like my food very spicy. My favorite food right now is Chinese beef noodle soup.
					<br><img src="images/cramen.jpg" width= 100% alt="">Looks tasty, isn't it? But I really miss my parents' cooking! My dad makes superb biryani. I wish he and my mom was here.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Coding and stuff</h2>
				<p>
					I've always seen kids younger than me go to hackathons, olympiads, competetive programing but I was afraid of coding. Unless one of my teacher taught me C and I found out it was not that scary as I expected. When I first started learning HTML and CSS, it was fun, but the more you learn the worse it becomes. Yabai! But when I was introduced to JavaScript, I was surprised to find that it is very similar to C.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Some tips</h2>
				<p>
					I'm still figuring out how all these web desinging stuff work. But I have found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> more helpful than any other sources. No sign-up required, just start learning right away. I also watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez">Bro Code</a>, but sometimes he covers a topic too fast of too briefly. For JavaScript, W3Schools has an example based learning method which is more effective I guess. After learning the basics, you should start playing around with stuffs you just learned- find a template, open devtools, edit it, break it!
